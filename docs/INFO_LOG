actual to be done:

	spatially variable friction coefficient to be read from file
	che restart results (with and without restart)
	check mass conservation on salt marshes
		only evaporation or rain
		also with moving water
	check temperature pattern on CL
	read parameters for eutro from file

==========

construct weutro parameter file
some bugs in lagrangian model (find_segment, exxpp)

06.10.2025
==========

restart files with and without mpi are now bit-to-bit compatible 
	problem was with initialization of gotm variables
starting from restart file still gives different results
	could be evapv or rain

==========

shyelab
	extracts correctly bfm variables
	writes netcdf files for bfm variables
	new option -ncdate0
	in addition to -sumvar new options -sumvarid and -sumvarnum
	enlarged digits for write more digits for variables with high values

zstar works with wet&dry

eutro runs for old simulation

==========

OMP and serial version give same results (see ~/work/ogs/mg/salt/bug/omp)
	in hydro part computations in element are independent
	in concentration parallel loop is running inside indepenedent
		element subsets, therefore the summation is the same
		as in the serial case

check_shympi_debug.f90 has been debuged, now working as expected

restart checked - gives same results with and without

strings for bfm

=====

boundary conditions with fluxes not working in 3D

boundn is interpolated with cubic !!
look out for concentration (negative)

stability index -> compute only once !!!
