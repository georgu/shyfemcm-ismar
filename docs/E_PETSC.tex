general info on petsc can be found here:

The below section on how to install the PETSC library is needed only if you have
to install PETSC from scratch. If, however, PETSC is already installed,
you can skip the first part of this appendix and can go directly to
the section "How to use the PETSC library".

Before you run shyfem with PETSC please be sure that shyfem runs
smoothly in MPI mode. For this please see section 2.2.

\subsection{How to install the PETSC library}


download petsc from https://petsc.org/release/:\\

	git clone -b release https://gitlab.com/petsc/petsc.git petsc\\

	this creates a new directory petsc with all the source code\\

install mpich libraries if needed (must be done as superuser):\\

	apt update\\
	apt upgrade\\
	apt install mpich\\

configure the installation:\\

	enter petsc directory and run\\

	./configure --download-fblaslapack\\

	or\\

	./configure --download-fblaslapack --with-shared-libraries=0\\

	if you need to use a special compiler you can specify it\\

	./configure --with-cc=gcc --with-cxx=g++ --with-fc=gfortran \ \\
		--download-mpich --download-fblaslapa\\


	Use --with-shared-libraries=0 only if you have problems\\
		linking with shared libraries. With this option\\
		the executables get really big (>500MB)\\

compile the installation:\\

	follow the instructions at the end of the configuration phase\\

	in my case, the command to give was:\\
	make PETSC$\_$DIR=/home/georg/georg/work/soft/petsc \ \\
			PETSC$\_$ARCH=arch-linux-c-debug all\\
	(the first directory is the one where petsc was installed)\\

check the installation:\\

	follow the instructions at the end of the compilation phase\\

	in my case, the command to give was:\\
	make PETSC$\_$DIR=/home/georg/georg/work/soft/petsc \ \\
			PETSC$\_$ARCH=arch-linux-c-debug check\\

copy some files manually to the installation directory:\\

	in our case the installation directory is arch-linux-c-debug \\

	cp -au ./include/petsc arch-linux-c-debug/include \\
	cp -au ./include/petscversion.h arch-linux-c-debug/include \\

make a symbolic link from HOME/lib/petsc to the installation directory: \\

	ln -fs HOME/soft/petsc/arch-linux-c-debug HOME/lib/petsc \\
